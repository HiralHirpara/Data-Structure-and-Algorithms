Subject: Internal Interest – [Job Title] Role
Hi [Recruiter’s Name],
I hope you're doing well. I’m currently working as a Software Engineer on the [team name, if known] team at Wells Fargo in San Francisco. I recently came across the opening for the [Job Title] role based in [Other Location], and I’m very interested in the opportunity.
Given my background in developing scalable Java-based REST API microservices using Spring Boot, and my strong collaboration across Agile teams, I believe I could bring valuable experience to the role.
That said, I wanted to check whether the team would consider candidates working from San Francisco, as I’m not in a position to relocate at this time.
I’ve attached my resume for your review. I’d really appreciate the chance to discuss the role further and learn more about the team’s goals and location flexibility.
Thank you for your time and consideration!
Best regards,
[Your Full Name]
